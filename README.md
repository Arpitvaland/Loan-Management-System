# Loan Management System

This project is designed to demonstrate a Loan Management System that includes loan prediction and tracking for customer defaults. It uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting, based on their financial information.

## Project Description

The Loan Management System aims to help financial institutions assess the risk associated with granting loans to applicants. It utilizes historical loan data, including applicant credit scores, income, loan amounts, and employment status, to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The system can also track and manage loan records for easier decision-making and data-driven actions.

## Features

- **Loan Default Prediction**: Machine learning model to predict if a loan applicant is likely to default based on features like credit score, income, and loan amount.
- **Loan Data Management**: Ability to manage and track customer loan records, including status updates, due dates, and payment schedules.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate reports to help assess loan risks and defaults, using tools like Tableau, SQL, and Excel for visualizing loan trends and key metrics.
- **Data Integration**: Integration with external databases (SQL, Excel) to fetch, update, and manage loan records.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For machine learning model training and prediction.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the loan prediction model.
- **SQL**: For managing loan data in relational databases.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing loan trends and insights.
- **Excel**: For quick data analysis and reporting.

## Requirements

### Python Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### SQL Database
- A relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL to store and manage loan records.
- SQL queries to fetch and update loan records.

### Tableau
- Use Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public for visualizing loan data and generating reports.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-management.git
   cd loan-management
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
   Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook for Loan Prediction**
   Open the `loan_prediction_model.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and follow the steps to train the machine learning model and make predictions.

4. **Run Python Script for Loan Prediction**
   If you prefer to run the prediction through a Python script, execute:
   ```bash
   python src/loan_prediction.py
   ```

5. **SQL Database Setup**
   - Set up your SQL database and use the provided `loan_management.sql` script to create tables and manage loan records.
   - Connect to the database and run SQL queries to update or fetch loan data.

6. **Tableau Reporting**
   - Open Tableau and connect to the dataset or SQL database to visualize the loan data and create reports.
